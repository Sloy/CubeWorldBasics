    <string name="home_about">Cube World is a 3D action RPG for PC made by Wollay and his wife. It was released in July 2013, and is still under continued development. It is currently available for purchase at $20. Gameplay is inspired by well-established games of similar genres, like Diablo and Minecraft, aiming to combine the best aspects of randomly-generated content, exploration, combat, and customization.</string>
    <string name="classes_about">Classes determine the main abilities and traits of your Cube World character. Along with specializations, they are your characters main distinguishing factor.</string>
    <string name="controls_about">Gameplay begins by creating a character of your choosing. This involves selecting from a variety of customizations, including race, cosmetics and your class. Afterward, you must select which world you wish to adventure into; these worlds are randomly-generated based on an initial seed. Once you have been dropped into your world with your chosen character, you are free to explore with climbing, sailing and hanggliding. Your character gains new abilities by gaining experience and progressing in levels; this is done through combat and daily mission completion. Your character also gains new items which can further increase the power of your character. Some items can be equipped, others are consumable such as foods and potions, and some can be used in crafting to create even better items. Your character can also tame and collect pets, which will assist you in combat.</string>
    <string name="equipment_about">Equipment is a name for items that can be equipped into the main equipment slots. Equipment can have different Rarity levels. Equipment includes weapons, armor and amulets. Armor and weapons can also change your character\'s appearance when equipped.</string>
    <string name="crafting_about">Crafting is the method used in Cube World to create Items such as armor and weapons through the use of materials and formulas.\nIn order to craft different items, the player can use the crafting menu (C key), though certain items can only be crafted while the player is standing near specific crafting props (Fires, Spinning Wheels, Anvils, Workbenches, and Saws are examples). Each class (Warrior, Ranger, Spirit Mage and Rogue) can only craft Armour and Weapons available to that class. The crafting categories are Weapon Crafting, Armor Crafting, Jewel Crafting, Cooking and Alchemy.</string>
    <string name="items_about">Items can be obtained from Mobs, Missions, NPCs. Apart from that, items are also craft-able.</string>
    <string name="monsters_about"></string>
    <string name="pets_about">Pets are friendly mobs whose primary purpose is to defend the character they\'re accompanying. They are equippable, as is the case with most items.</string>
    <string name="races_about">There are currently three subtypes of Races in Cube World. All three types are humanoid. They are playable, neutral and hostile. The playable races you can choose in Cube World determines your character\'s physical appearance. As of the alpha, none of the races currently have any specific traits or perks.\nThere are also nine playable races in Cube World, these races also appear in-game as friendly NPCs and hostile Mobs.</string>
    <string name="world_about">A main feature of Cube World is the random world generation. In contrast to many games, worlds are not designed by a level designer, but procedurally generated by the game using equations and random numbers. The result is an infinite world.</string>

    <!-- about classes -->
    <string name="warrior_about">Warriors are one of the four playable classes in CubeWorld. Warriors are described as "masters of close-range combat" and possibly the most \'combat-ready\' of all classes. They can deal, as well as receive, a fair amount of Damage, enabling them to fight enemies that would otherwise be much too strong for them at lower levels. Warriors may wield a single Great Weapon, two One-Handed Weapons, or a One-Handed Weapon with a Shield and wear heavy armor. Warriors can play as one of two specializations (see specializations).</string>
    <string name="ranger_about">The Ranger is the most fitting choice to specialize in mid-to-long range combat, preferring to keep a safe distance from enemies.\nDepending on specialization, Rangers tend to either snipe from afar or nimbly evade hits from mid-range. They wear medium armor and can attack with bows, crossbows or boomerangs and benefit from the ability of Stealth.</string>
    <string name="mage_about">The Spirit Mage fits the Magic-user archetype in Cube World. The Spirit Mage can use wands, staves, and bracelets for weapons, and wears light armor. Unlike other classes, the Spirit Mage passively generates spirit over time. There are currently two Spirit Mage specializations: Fire Mage and Water Mage.</string>
    <string name="rogue_about">The Rogue class is a high-damage, low-health melee fighter that utilizes movement, dodging, and stealth mechanics to deal and avoid damage. Rogues must move in close to enemies to deal damage and lack the safety of strong armors, healing abilities, or ranged attacks and therefore must be played carefully if the player wants to succeed.\nThe Rogue class wears medium armor and can choose either the Assassin or Ninja specialization.</string>
    
    <string name="weapon_crafting_about">Each class can craft weapons available to that class. For instance, warriors can craft axes, swords, maces, and shields.</string>
    <string name="armor_crafting_about">Each class can craft armor available to that class. For instance, warriors can craft iron gloves, iron boots, and more.</string>
    <string name="jewel_crafting_about">All classes can craft rings and amulets. Rings and amulets have secondary stats useful for all classes.</string>
    <string name="cooking_about">Players can craft food for cheap out-of-combat healing and buffs.</string>
    <string name="alchemy_about">Players can craft healing potions and other useful potions.</string>
    <string name="precious_stone_about">A player can find four different types of precious stones when they are mining in caves. They are used to craft higher tiers of equipements.</string>
    
    <string name="accessories_about">Accessories are equipment that do not fit into armor or weapons. Currently these are amulets, rings, pets(or pet food) and lamps.\nAmulets and rings are craft-able by all classes, their recipes can be learned from a formula or via experience.\nAccessory items slightly augment a character\'s statistics, and in the case of amulets, can affect the character\'s appearance.</string>
    <string name="armor_about">Armor is a type of equipment that protects your character from damage. It be made from different materials, such as Iron, Obsidian, and Bone. Armor can be crafted or obtained as drops from mobs.</string>
    <!-- <string name=""></string> -->
    <string name="weapons_about">Weapons are equipment used to deal damage to opponents during combat. Weapons do not degrade and do not have a durability.\nCurrently, there are 11 different variations (look of the weapon) for each category.</string>
    <string name="special_about">The special equipment slot at this time only has use for hanggliding and boats.</string>
    
    <string name="food_about">Food is an item that restores health when eaten and may also give buffs. Unlike potions, a player cannot move when eating food. Food heals less quickly when eaten compared to health potions, but the ingredients are more plentiful and they do not require glass bottles from town. Crafting food can be done at any Campfire. The player can interrupt the process of eating food with a single mouse click, however, the item will be lost. In turn, food is best used for healing outside of combat.</string>
    <string name="potions_about">Potions are items that provide benefits to the character, including healing and buffs. Currently the only two known potions are the Life Potion and the Cactus Potion.\nHumanoid Mobs can also use potions.</string>
    <string name="valuables_about">Coins, as with many games, are the form of currency in Cube World.\nThe amount of coins a character is carrying displayed within the inventory panel.</string>
    
    <string name="bosses_about">Bosses are the strongest Mobs in Cube World.</string>
    <string name="hostile_about">Hostile Mobs are entities that will attack any player they see on sight, regardless of whatever the player does. It is possible to escape from a hostile mob as they will give up the chase after a set amount of time.</string>
    <string name="passive_about">Passive Mobs are either friendly or neutral Mobs. If a Passive Mob is attacked, (Represented by a Green Health Bar), it will become hostile to the player. Some Mobs are completely friendly to the player, and cannot be attacked directly. (Represented by a Blue Health Bar). Note that such mobs can still be attacked by the player by, for example, laying a bomb next to them and having it explode. However, they still don\'t attack back. Other than that, no Mobs in towns can be attacked, be they an NPC or Pets. This does not include mobs led into towns via aggro, only those spawned in towns.</string>
    <string name="npcs_about">An NPC (Non-Player Character) is a character found in Cube World that no player controls. They appear as villagers, adventurers, or even bosses.</string>
    <string name="rare_about">Most mobs are able to spawn as rare mobs in the wilderness. They generally have a randomly generated name in purple, displayed above their species. Rare mobs are larger than the original mob and glow purple, like mission bosses. They can also have special abilities. These mobs will always drop a type of Spirit Cube. When you find one, note its location on the map as they respawn like any other boss and regular mob.</string>
    
    <string name="taming_about">Pets are tamed by holding the associated pet food out for them to eat. Simply equip the food item into the pet slot and go up to the pet desired. The pet does not have to be friendly to tame it. Just equip the pet food before you are in sight of the harmful pet and then approach. If more than one neutral animal is trying to eat your pet food, the one which finishes first will become your pet, while the others will start attacking you. Also bosses can be tamed, when a boss is tamed it will change into normal sized pet, and sometimes will duplicate the boss in the world, causing it to continue attacking the player.</string>
    <!-- <string name="pet_types"></string> -->
    <string name="leveling_about">Pets gain experience when Mobs are killed (but your pet needs to be alive when the mob is killed to gain the experience). A pet will receive the same experience as their master receives. This appears to be broken sometimes while playing in parties. Pets keep their level and experience when stored.</string>
    <string name="pet_naming_about">To rename a pet, press the return key (Enter) to bring up the chat and type: /namepet &lt;name&gt; (&lt;name&gt; being the desired name of the pet). If desired, to add spaces in a pet\'s name, press the Spacebar then hold Ctrl and press the Backspace key. The game thinks there is no longer a space there, but there is, allowing one to give a pet a longer name like "Terry the Great". This method may be changed in future updates.</string>
    <string name="pet_stamina_about">Pet stamina are shown as 5 blue water droplet icons and depletes over time when riding. When all icons disappear the pet is not mountable for a period of time until a stamina icon is visible again. Pet stamina regenerates almost immediately when on or in water. Stamina is shared between all pets. This means that you can\'t simply swap out pets when stamina is depleted on one.</string>
    
    <string name="human_about">Humans are a playable race; they look similar to humans in real life. They are medium-sized creatures and have a large variety of hair and beard styles. Male humans differ from female humans in many of the way humans differ in real life: male humans can have moustaches and beards, and female humans have longer hair. Another difference that sets male humans apart from female humans is the size and shape of the eyes and eyebrows. Humans currently have the most customization of all the races: 6 faces and 15 hairstyles. When comparing the in game human to the average human against things like trees and buildings (i.e. 5\'6") this human actually sits around 5\'4".</string>
    <string name="elf_about">Elves are a Human-like (medium-sized stature) race with pale skin, pointed ears, and fancy hair. Their gender differences are much like the humans\', the most noticeable one being the eye and eyebrow size and shape.\nElves are one of the current playable races. They have no known race bonuses or weaknesses but, being medium-sized, they can not navigate in certain places that smaller races (like dwarfs) can.</string>
    <string name="dwarf_about">Dwarves are one of eight playable races in Cube World. Dwarves are characterized by their small size and large red noses. Their gender differences are very noticeable: males have smaller eyes, wide mouths with a large lower lip, and always have beards. Females possess larger eyes, and often have braided hair.\nSince Dwarves are naturally smaller than other races, they are one of the few races that can fit through Windows (The only other current race being Goblins). They also posses a smaller hitbox, which makes them more difficult to hit than larger races. Their strong agility serves to enhance their strength as ranged classes, as although they are easily knocked back, their size allows for easier dodging against charging assailants.\nHowever, their height renders them more vulnerable when shooting from a high vantage point, as they will have to be closer to the edge in order to access a similar view to that of taller races (Orcs and Humans). Additionally, their size results in their increased susceptibility to knock-back and decreased infliction of knock-back upon other classes.\nIt is therefore necessary to consider these strengths and weaknesses when playing as a Dwarf, as they have a strong impact on the overall gameplay of the race.\nDwarves tend to roam throughout the wilderness in groups of 4+.</string>
    <string name="orc_about">Orcs are a playable Race and a mob that uses the class system. They are large humanoid creatures with large heads, a bulky frame, green skin, often scars, and a pronounced lower jaw. Female Orcs can be told apart from their male versions for their hairstyles, much larger eyes and smaller jaw. They are usually green, and mainly come from the Marsh lands.</string>
    <string name="goblin_about">Goblins are a playable race with a very long jaw and pointy nose. They are the second smallest race in the game, being smaller than all other races but the Dwarf. Male Goblins can be told apart from Female Goblins due to the shape of their heads and eyes; Female Goblins have rounder heads and larger eyes than their male counterparts.\nGoblins make excellent choices for Spiritual Mages due to their small size and naturally small hitbox. This allows for very easy dodging of any incoming projectiles. They can climb through windows and are the only race apart from the dwarf with this ability.</string>
    <string name="lizardmen_about">Lizardmen are a playable race, and also an aggressive mob. They are humanoid reptillian creatures with green, scaly skin, large mouths lined with sharp teeth, scaly mohawks topping their heads and sharp eyes with rectangular red pupils and sclera of variable colors, including yellow. Lizardwomen can be told apart from Lizardmen by the size of their snouts and their eyelashes, since Lizardmen don\'t have any eyelashes and have longer snouts.</string>
    <string name="undead_about">Undead is a playable race. They are represented by a skeleton-like humanoid creature with a decayed appearance and glowing eyes. Their male and female version can be told apart by the size of their jaw and the shape of their eyes and eyelashes (The female version has a smaller jaw that is closed and large eyelashes, while the male version\'s jaw is larger and has small eyelashes).\nUndead is also a mob that can be found roaming the surface and dungeons of Cube World.</string>
    <string name="frogman_about">Frogmen are one of eight playable races in Cube World. Frogmen are amphibious creatures with slit-like eyes, and big cheeks. Their gender differences aren\'t very noticeable: males have regular, frog eyes, while females have a more frilly appearance regarding their eyes, which have long eyelashes. They possess average height compared to the other playable races.\nThey may be a reference of the character Glenn, of the game Chrono Trigger.</string>
    
    <string name="biomes_about">Landscapes are geographical environments in Cube World.\nEach landscape has a unique climate and theme, as well as unique flora and fauna. Currently a world can consist of six different landscapes. Four additional landscapes are due for future updates of the game.</string>
    <string name="caves_about">Caves are often large areas that can be found around a large mountainous area. Cave entrances can often be found in a mountain wall, but in some cases there is no entrance, and the player has to blow up part of the terrain or a boulder to get access to the cave. Boulders can block cave entrances or tunnels. In caves, currently two types of mobs spawn: bats and slimes.</string>
    <string name="cities_about">Cities have randomly-generated buildings that NPCs reside in, which may sell you items or simply interact with you.\nArchitecture for each City currently has five known styles: European, North American, Medieval, Desert, and Log. In addition to regular cities, each land area has a Capital City with the name of the area.</string>
    <string name="dungeons_about">A dungeon is a procedurally-generated landmark in the world which generally has its name visible on the region map. Currently all dungeons are loosely spaced out across the map in a grid. It is unknown if this is subject to change in future versions.\nDungeons are dangerous places full of rare loot and are integrated into the world. Dungeon enemies are often stronger than normal enemies and there are dungeon bosses. Dungeons occur in different forms, such as castles, ruins, temples, islands, pyramids, and catacombs. Apart from that, there are over-world dungeons, which are less structured and consist of disconnected buildings.\nEvery dungeon has a Runestone, which can teleport the player back to its entrance.</string>
	<string name="seeds_about">A Seed is certain value that influences the generation of any world in Cube World. It can be any alpha-numeric combination. Seeds can be used to share worlds with friends without multiplayer.</string>
